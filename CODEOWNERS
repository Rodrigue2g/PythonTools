# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @Rodrigue2g will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @Rodrigue2g

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @Rodrigue2g and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
#*.go docs@designø.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
#*.txt @Rodrigue2g/Designø

# In this example, @Rodrigue2g owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/src/ @Rodrigue2g

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
#docs/*  docs@designø.com

# In this example, @Rodrigue2g owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
#apps/ @Rodrigue2g

# In this example, @Rodrigue2g owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
#/docs/ @Rodrigue2g

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @Rodrigue2g.
#/scripts/ @Rodrigue2g 

# In this example, @Rodrigue2g owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
